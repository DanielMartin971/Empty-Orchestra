# Empty Orchestra || Rock On API Usage

## User Story

I want to be able to find concerts and other events that are happening nearby or in other places
I need to see who is playing
I want to be able to get tickets or links to other sites selling tickets for the venue or concert

## Description

This is the first group project in the bootcamp. What was expected was for us to work together as a team and use a API for our website. We were split into groups of 4 and then it was decided in our group to split into teams of 2. The teams were then tasked with either the HTML and design, and the other team was tasked with getting a API, learning its functionality, the documentation, and utilizing it. We used the Ticketmaster API for our website and made a rock themed webpage that allowed the user to search for a band and see what upcoming events are going on. It would change the image to show the headliner, also give the description of when the concert was to happen and where at. The HTML portion of the project was utilizing some fonts we found that matched a rock theme and give a cochella type of color to the webpage.

## Installation

We went from scratch. It consisted of doing a lot of research to look up the APIs; Seatgeek and Ticketmaster. 

## Usage

To access the page you use the deployed URL to see the webpage.
